## Migration from Create React App

This project was migrated from Create React App to Vite for faster development and build times. The key changes included:

1. Setting up a Vite project structure
2. Moving API proxying from setupProxy.js to vite.config.js
3. Updating the entry point from index.js to main.jsx
4. Configuring the build process for optimized production assets

## Proxy Configuration

The application proxies API requests to the backend service running at http://localhost:5000. This is configured in the `vite.config.js` file.
